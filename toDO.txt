NEW: 
    1) have all tags be case-insensative. That is, when loading them into db put them lower case and every query should also be made lower case
    2) when clicking filter 
    3) have the footer at the bottom of the page even if the content doesn't reach the bottom of the page + create a little dotted sperator or something to sperate t from teh doc (may not be necessery)
    4) Date currently always loads on 0th of month, why? -- fix that
    5) DONE - filter should auto-target the textbox 
    6) DONE - everything that is clicky should have css "cursor:pointer;" (in filter box -- that looks really nice) -- are the colors tied to the user's selection somehow? they should be 
    7) filter should show soem options suggested by the user
    8) seperate the config into different jsons to make it more editable 
    9) displaty tags on side boxes
    10) have the filter box autocomplete 
    11) allow user to set their page margins (some people may prefer narrower)
    12) allow favicon upload. 
    13) have optional head tagline 

OLD:
    5) Have a routing feature that you can go to /basketball (let's say) and it has only basketball tags, and perhaps an option for a different title
    11) display posts by latest
    12) MOBILE STYLING - : ( just get a laptop plz ahahah -- sike we'll have to do This



-- could add an in-page meta tag that contains the title and author; may be a 
        cleaner solution. 
-- enforce a size for all posts? 
-- refactor so that we have a method called scroll element + scroll the page title

I need an adjacent word to blog...  



============================
PROMPT DESIGN (compilation script)
On first compilation: 
    - say hello & explain how it will work (feel free to skip anything!) & link tutorial & more info & changes aren't permanent (no input)
    - Ask for the name of the xBlog (string -- truncate starting and ending spaces) 
    - Ask for the links <exampleSite,https://example-site.com>,<matanBlog,https://matanshtepel.com> -- but first see what input type string does
    - Description of blog (?)

On posts compilation: 
    - Title (string)
    - Author (string)
    - Tags (list)
~~background add
    - date (UTC)
    - Date_readable (string)
    - filename
    - id -- numPost (String (I think because the id's are strings)) 



==============
START MESSEGE
xBlog is a fully frontend, GitHub-pages-oriented, minimum set-up necessary, blogging utility. 
This script will ask you various set-up questions you may have not fully decided, but do not worry, everything can be changed!
After the compilation is needed, your fascinating writing will be prepered to be displayed on the interenet!
To learn more visit __repo_link__ or check out the tutorial videos at __Vidlink__

Let's get started!

First and foremost, what is the name of your blog? __ 

There will be a navbar at the top of the page that can contain a few navbars, if you would like.
If you would, input them (don't know list formatting yet)

Lastly, add a one line description of your page. 


===============
USUAL PROMPT MESSEGE
What is the title of filename? 

Who is the author of filename? -- (autocomplete could be nice)

Tags (list)

/! major change: no more compilation script for new info, include at top of page!
